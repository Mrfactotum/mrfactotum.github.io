## Mr. Factotum's website

On this site you'll find all sorts of tools that I've developed to make my life easier..or will develop. Maybe some of them can be of use to you too?

**Mr. Factotum's Data Manifesto**
I believe strongly that your data is your property. Whether that is your email address, metadata coming from your phone or data from devices connected to the internet your data should be under your control. Developing software and tools helps me be more efficient and I look forward to sharing my creations and collaborating on them with you. Everyone should be able to choose what they do with their data, who has access to it and what it is used for. The software developed here will strive to be programs that let you control your information. If for some reason that's not possible, perhaps I'm using a third party to process data, that will be explicitly mentioned. I know I would want to know for my own use and I want you to know as well. 

None of these things come with any kind of warranty and you use them at your own risk. Happy Coding
